# üåê Web Server Framework

A lightweight **Java web framework** designed for serving static files and building RESTful services using lambda functions.  
It extends a simple HTTP server into a fully functional framework for modern web application development.

---

## üìå Project Statement

**Project:** Development of a web framework for REST services and static file management.

**Objective:**  
This project enhances an existing web server (supporting HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and images) into a complete **web framework**.  
The framework enables developers to:

- Define **REST services** using Java lambda functions.
- Handle **query parameters** in incoming requests.
- Specify the **location of static files** for serving web assets.

---

## üîë Scope & Features

1. **Static GET method for REST services**  
   Developers can define REST endpoints with simple lambda expressions:

   ```java
   get("/hello", (req, res) -> "hello world!");

   ```

2. **Query parameter extraction**
   Provides a mechanism to access query parameters directly in REST services.

   ```java
   get("/hello", (req, res) -> "hello " + req.getValues("name"));

   ```

3. **Static file directory specification**
   Allows developers to define where static files (HTML, CSS, JS, images) are located.

   ```java
   staticfiles("webroot");
   ```

## Verifying Java and Maven Versions

Before compiling or running this project, make sure that both **Java** and **Maven** are properly installed and configured on the system.

### Check Java version

Run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
java -version
```

Check Maven version:

```bash
mvn -version
```

2. **Run the server:**

   ```sh
   mvn clean compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="co.edu.escuelaing.webexample.WebApplication"
   ```

## üóÇÔ∏è Static Files with `staticfiles()`

The framework provides the **`staticfiles()`** method to define the folder where static resources (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) are stored.  

When the project is compiled with Maven, these resources are automatically copied into the directory: 
target/classes/webroot

## Prototype architecture

The system follows a **lightweight web server and REST application architecture**.  
It is divided into three main parts: the **Client**, the **Web Application (API REST)**, and the **Web Server / Microframework**.

---

### 1. Client
- The client (e.g., **Browser**, **Postman**, or another HTTP client) sends an **HTTP Request** to the application.  
- It later receives an **HTTP Response** back from the server.  

---

### 2. Web Application (API REST)
- Represented by the `WebApplication` class.  
- Defines the **REST endpoints** and the **business logic**.  
- Does **not** directly manage sockets or raw HTTP connections.  
- Relies on the underlying `HttpServer` to handle HTTP communication.  
- Registers services (routes/endpoints) and delegates execution to the server infrastructure.  

---

### 3. Web Server / Microframework
The core of the custom framework, composed of several classes working together:

#### üîπ `HttpServer`
- Core of the framework; listens for incoming client connections.  
- Routes HTTP requests (`GET`, `POST`, etc.) to the appropriate service.  
- Serves **dynamic content** (via `Service`) and **static files** (from `/target/classes/webroot/...`).  
- Handles request parsing, response building, and error responses (e.g., **404 Not Found**).  

#### üîπ `HttpRequest`
- Encapsulates HTTP request details: **URI**, **method**, **query parameters**, **headers**, and **body**.  
- Provides helper methods to access and parse request data.  

#### üîπ `HttpResponse`
- Represents the server‚Äôs response back to the client.  
- Includes **status code**, **status message**, **headers**, and **body**.  
- Provides helper methods to set status, add headers, and build the final response.  

#### üîπ `Service`
- Defines the **business logic contract** for handling requests.  
- Each service implements the method `executeService(req, res)` to process a request and return a response.  
- Allows `HttpServer` to stay generic, delegating execution to services.

‚úÖ **Summary of Relationships**
- **WebApplication** ‚Üí defines REST endpoints (API).  
- **HttpServer** ‚Üí acts as a lightweight web framework.  
- **HttpRequest / HttpResponse** ‚Üí represent the HTTP communication.  
- **Service** ‚Üí executes the business logic.
